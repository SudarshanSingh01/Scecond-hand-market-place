	â€¢	Supports modular development and easy transition to layered architecture.
3. File Structure Maintenance
	â€¢	users.txt is created and used for storing user credentials and data persistently.
4. Auto File Creation for CRUD
	â€¢	Automatically creates users.txt if it does not exist.
	â€¢	Appends new users and reads credentials for login.
5. I/O File Connectivity
	â€¢	Uses BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileWriter, and FileReader for file input/output.
6. Planned Layered Architecture
	â€¢	Future-ready structure that can evolve into:
	â—¦	Model (User, Product)
	â—¦	Service Layer (business logic)
	â—¦	Repository Layer (file handling)
	â—¦	UI Layer (console interface)
7. Input Validation
	â€¢	Validates category and sub-category input.
	â€¢	Checks if User ID is already taken during sign-up.
	â€¢	Validates login with correct password and User ID.
8. Accuracy of Output
	â€¢	Displays accurate messages for signup, login, and category navigation.
	â€¢	Reflects user's selected action (buy/sell) and category.
